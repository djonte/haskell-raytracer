# Haskell Raytracer

The goal is to follow the ["Ray Tracing in One Weekend" guide](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html#outputanimage) by Peter Shirley, Trevor David Black and Steve Hollasch with a twist. I'll make it with Haskell. This poses several challenges as my knowledge in Haskell is severely limited (mostly from IndaPlus {first year in KTH} and DD1366 Programmeringsparadigm, where the latter contains a few projects in the language). Another challenge is to convert the thinking of an imperative solution (in which the tutorial is written) to a functional paradigm.
